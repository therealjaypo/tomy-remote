# AS3 Tomy Remote

Generates all the tones needed to get some basic motion happening with a Tomy Omnibot.

## You'll Need

* A Tomy Omnibot
* A discman casette adapter
* Something that runs Flash and has a headphone jack
* Flash Builder 4 (or a reasonable facsimilie)
* Adobe Flex SDK 3.5
* Flash Player 10+

## Usage

Either run the source (or use the html and swf in the bin-output directory), connect the tape adapter to your [whatever]'s headphone jack, throw it in the Omnibot's casette player and push Play.

I haven't played with this in years, but it worked pretty well the last time I did.

## Abandonware

This is abandonware. I'm not going to be developing it any further, I just threw it up here in case it helps someone else.
